## My process

I look at the design, then I write the html first so then I can move on to CSS.
I have not learned about CSS Grid and media queries just yet, so that is why I did not include them in this project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to center elements using flexbox and applying shadows.
I had a hard time getting paddings right, I know it is not 100% but I think that is okay.

### Continued development

Right now I try to focus on html and css only until I have a strong and solid foundation before moving on to JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [MDN on box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me with setting shadows around things. MDN is really useful and I heighly recommend it.
